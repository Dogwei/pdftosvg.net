# ApproximateCmyk

This tool was used to generate the CMYK approximation function used by PdfToSvg.NET.
There are probably smarter ways of doing this, but the result on tested images is quite good.

To run the tool, you need to have `TR003_Char_Data.csv` in the working directory. It can be found here:
